# Release Plan Template [Draft]
This Release Plan Template is intended to be used to help ensure your new VSP product or feature is ready for launch and will deliver the desired user outcomes. In Phase 1, you will test your product to learn how it'll actually be used, what problems it might create, and then fix/adjust if necesssary prior to going live. In Phase 2, you will define the launch communications plan and post-launch KPIs. 

You do not need to complete a release plan for a product or feature update that does not:

- Add substantial new functionality to the Platform.
- Impact user flows through tasks.

For your product or feature, make a copy of this template and check it into products/platform/<product-name>.

- How you'll recruit test users:
- How you'll give test users access to the product:

## Post-launch Questions

*To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above.*

2. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
3. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated?
4. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
