# Platform product categorization pilot

1) Roadmap
2) CTO platform deck
3) VSP + DEPO weekly sync deck


## What we want to learn from this pilot

- Can people repeat back what the Platform does after seeing it in this way?
- Can people identify gaps, what they'd want to see more of from these areas?
- Do people feel surprised about things we provide that they weren't previously aware of?
-
